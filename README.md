👋 Hi there! I'm Sreekanth, a curious and enthusiastic learner with a passion for programming.
😊 Although I'm not a pro (yet!), I enjoy tinkering with code and exploring new technologies. Whether it's building simple projects or diving into more complex ones, I always strive to learn and grow as a developer.
🧑‍💻 I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and try out new things.
❤️ When I'm not coding, you can find me designing and editing stuffs. I believe that a well-rounded life is key to staying creative and inspired!
