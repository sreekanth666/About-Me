# Hi there, I'm Sreekanth ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate of BSc Computer Science from Sri C Achuthamenon Government College in Thrissur, Kerala. My skills include team management, C programming, HTML, CSS, PHP, and leadership. I'm currently learning Python Django and MEARN stack.

## ðŸ”­ Project Description

The Attendance Management System is a web application that simplifies the process of recording attendance and managing attendance data for students and faculty. The system allows students to log in, view their attendance records, and apply for leave requests. Faculty members can view student attendance reports, approve or deny leave requests, and add new courses or classes.

The system is being developed using PHP, MySQL, and HTML/CSS. The system also incorporates best practices for security and user privacy.

I'm currently learning MEARN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js).
